## 🚀 Future Projects (all projects are currently not present in github, they releases will come in some months... or years):
1. [onebin](https://github.com/arthur-manske/kmin/tree/master/cmd) - "The one binary to rule them all". It's a small collection of utilities that follows the POSIX® guidelines. May have extensions in relation to the default POSIX® behavior.
2. [devbin](https://github.com/arthur-manske/kmin/tree/master/cmd) -  A `onebin`, but for development utilities. 
3. [alc](https://github.com/arthur-manske/kmin/tree/master/libs/c) - Another libc, a tiny C library. Mostly POSIX® compliant.
4. [bb](https://github.com/arthur-manske/kmin/tree/master/boot/) - A basic bootloader.

## 📁 Old Projects (and private):
1. [lis](https://github.com/ArthurMXVI/lis) - Non-POSIX® implementation of `ls` in rust, unlikely to return. 
2. [rem](https://github.com/ArthurMXVI/rem) - Non-POSIX® implementations of `rm` n rust, unlikely to return.
